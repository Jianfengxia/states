Raven Mail
==========

This formula will install an executable script that check the activity of
:doc:`/sentry/doc/index`.
After installed, this script will emulate ``/usr/bin/mail`` but send mail
to a :doc:`/sentry/doc/index` server instead.

To start checking, please run command::

    echo "My Test" | /usr/bin/mail

Then check your mailbox or Sentry WebUI for result.

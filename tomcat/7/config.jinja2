Run Tomcat as this user ID. Not setting this or leaving it blank will use the
default of tomcat7.
#}
TOMCAT7_USER=tomcat7

{#-
Run Tomcat as this group ID. Not setting this or leaving it blank will use
the default of tomcat7.

TOMCAT7_GROUP=tomcat7

{#-
 The home directory of the Java development kit (JDK). You need at least
 JDK version 1.5. If JAVA_HOME is not set, some common directories for
 OpenJDK, the Sun JDK, and various J2SE 1.5 versions are tried.
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-6-jdk
#}

{#-
 You may pass JVM startup parameters to Java here. If unset, the default
 options will be: -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC

 Use "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" to enable the CMS garbage collector (improved
 response time). If you use that option and you run Tomcat on a machine with
 exactly one CPU chip that contains one or two cores, you should also add
 the "-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode" option.
#}
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC"

{#-
 To enable remote debugging uncomment the following line.
 You will then be able to use a java debugger on port 8000.
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"

 Java compiler to use for translating JavaServer Pages (JSPs). You can use all
 compilers that are accepted by Ant's build.compiler property.
JSP_COMPILER=javac

 Use the Java security manager? (yes/no, default: no)
TOMCAT7_SECURITY=no

 Number of days to keep logfiles in /var/log/tomcat7. Default is 14 days.
LOGFILE_DAYS=14

 Location of the JVM temporary directory
 WARNING: This directory will be destroyed and recreated at every startup !
JVM_TMP=/tmp/tomcat7-temp

 If you run Tomcat on port numbers that are all higher than 1023, then you
 do not need authbind.  It is used for binding Tomcat to lower port numbers.
 NOTE: authbind works only with IPv4.  Do not enable it when using IPv6.
 (yes/no, default: no)
AUTHBIND=yes

Rsync
=====

Introduction
------------

Rsync is a widely-used utility to keep copies of a file on two computer systems
the same. It is commonly found on Unix-like systems and functions as both a
file synchronization and file transfer program. The rsync algorithm, a type of
delta encoding is used to minimize network usage. Zlib may be used for additional
compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for data security.

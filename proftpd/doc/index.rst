.. TODO: INTRO

.. warning::

  `FTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftp>`_ is an insecure protocol,
  You should never use that. Please do not use this state.

But a client wanted to upload files from a special software used
during sports competitions.
They wanted to have the results available on their website.
And it only support FTP.

For security reason this state had been designed to be as less intrusive as
possible in the rest of the system.
It to depends on already existing PostgreSQL server to not not mess with Unix
users/passwords.

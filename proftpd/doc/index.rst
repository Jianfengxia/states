Introduction
------------

ProFTPD (short for Pro FTP daemon) is a :ref:`glossary-ftp` server. ProFTPD is Free and open-source
software, compatible with Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows (via Cygwin).
Along with vsftpd and Pure-FTPd, ProFTPD is among the most popular :ref:`glossary-ftp` servers
in Unix-like environments today. Compared to those, which focus e.g. on simplicity,
speed or security, ProFTPD's primary design goal is to be a highly feature rich
:ref:`glossary-ftp` server, exposing a large amount of configuration options to the user

possible in the rest of the system.
It to depends on already existing PostgreSQL server to not not mess with Unix

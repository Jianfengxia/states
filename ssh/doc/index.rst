SSH
===

Introduction
------------

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data
communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other
secure network services between two networked computers. It connects, via a
secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a client running SSH server
and SSH client programs, respectively. The protocol specification distinguishes
between two major versions that are referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.

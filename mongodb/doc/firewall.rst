Firewall
========

There is two way to communicate to a :doc:`index` server, one is native protocol
and the other is trough an :ref:`glossary-HTTP` API. You need to open the
following ports to all :doc:`index` clients based on your needs:

- :ref:`glossary-TCP` ``27017``: :doc:`index`
- :ref:`glossary-TCP` ``28017``: :doc:`index` over :ref:`glossary-HTTP`

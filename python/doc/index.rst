Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and
its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than
would be possible in languages such as C++ or :doc:`/java/doc/index`. The language
provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large
scale.

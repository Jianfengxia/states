Python
======

More can be find at official `Python page <https://www.python.org/>`_.

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its
design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
such as ref:`glossary-cplusplus` or :doc:`/java/doc/index`. The language
provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large
scale.

Amavis
======

More can be find at official `Amavisd page`_.

Amavis (more exactly ``amavisd-new``) grew out of ``amavisd``
(which in turn is a daemonized version of amavis-perl), but through five years
of development turned into a separate product, hardly resembling its origin.
The code is several times the size of its predecessor. See
`Amavisd page`_ for more information. Every use of
``amavisd`` or ``amavis`` is this documentation implies ``amavisd-new``.

 For some reason, purge amavisd-new Ubuntu package don't clean these.
 /var/run/amavis is $HOME of user amavis.
 So, when amavisd-new is uninstalled the first time the UID of this
 directory is changed to something else, once userdel amavis is executed.
 When amavisd-new is installed again, it can't write the PID file in
 /var/run/amavis. As the ownership is not for itself, it can't write the PID.
 This cause stopping the service to fail, as it can't find a PID.

{#-

 max_fsm_queue: Enable limiting of lengths of "message queues"
 for outgoing connections. Roughly speaking, each message in such
 queues represents one XML stanza queued to be sent into
 an output stream it is serving.
 The default value is an atom 'undefined' which specifies no limiting.

 When specified globally, this option limits the message queue lengths
 for all ejabberd_c2s_in and ejabberd_service listeners,
 as well as for outgoing s2s connections.

 This option can also be specified as an option for ejabberd_c2s_in
 and ejabberd_service listeners, in wich case it will override
 the value of the global option.

#}
{max_fsm_queue, 1000}.

{#-

 s2s_use_starttls: Enable STARTTLS + Dialback for S2S connections.
 Allowed values are: true or false.
 You must specify a certificate file.

#}
{s2s_use_starttls, true}.

{#-
 s2s_certfile: Specify a certificate file.

#}
{s2s_certfile, "/etc/ssl/{{ pillar['ejabberd']['ssl'] }}/server.pem"}.

{#-
 domain_certfile: Specify a different certificate for each served hostname.

{domain_certfile, "example.org", "/path/to/example_org.pem"}.
{domain_certfile, "example.com", "/path/to/example_com.pem"}.
#}

{#-

 S2S whitelist or blacklist

 Default s2s policy for undefined hosts.

{s2s_default_policy, allow}.
#}
%%
%% Allow or deny communication with specific servers.
{#-
%%{{s2s_host, "goodhost.org"}, allow}.
%%{{s2s_host, "badhost.org"}, deny}.
#}

{#-
 The maximum allowed delay for retry to connect
 after a failed connection attempt to a remote server, in seconds.
 The default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

 The reconnection algorythm works like this: if connection fails,
 ejabberd makes an initial random delay between 1 and 15 seconds,
 then retries, and if this attempt fails, makes another delay,
 twice as long as previous. These attempts are performed either
 until a successful connection is made or until the next calculated
 delay is greated or equal than the value of s2s_max_retry_delay.

{s2s_max_retry_delay, 300}.
#}

{#-
 Outgoing S2S options

 Preferred address families (which to try first) and connect timeout
 in milliseconds.

{outgoing_s2s_options, [ipv4, ipv6], 10000}.
#}

{#-
   AUTHENTICATION

 Authentication using ODBC
 Remember to setup a database in the next section.
#}
{auth_method, odbc}.

{#-
   DATABASE SETUP

{#-
 PostgreSQL server:

{odbc_server, {pgsql, "server", "database", "username", "password"}}.

 If you want to specify the port:
{odbc_server, {pgsql, "server", 1234, "database", "username", "password"}}.

 If you use PostgreSQL, have a large database, and need a
 faster but inexact replacement for "select count(*) from users"

{pgsql_users_number_estimate, true}.
#}

{odbc_server, {pgsql, "localhost", "{{ dbname }}", "{{ dbuser }}", "{{ dbuserpass }}"}}.

{#-
 Number of connections to open to the database for each virtual host
#}
{odbc_pool_size, {{ salt['pillar.get']('ejabberd:odbc_pool_size', 10) }} }.

{#-
 Interval to make a dummy SQL request to keep alive the connections
 to the database. Specify in seconds: for example 28800 means 8 hours
#}
{odbc_keepalive_interval, {{ salt['pillar.get']('ejabberd:odbc_keepalive_interval', 'undefined') }} }.

   TRAFFIC SHAPERS

{#-
   ACCESS CONTROL LISTS

 The 'admin' ACL grants administrative privileges to Jabber accounts.
 You can put as many accounts as you want.

{acl, test, {user_glob, "test*"}}.
#}

{#-
 Define specific ACLs in a virtual host.

 [
  {acl, admin, {user, "bob-local", "localhost"}}

#}

{#-
   ACCESS RULES

 Define the maximum number of time a single user is allowed to connect:
#}
{access, max_user_sessions, [{10, all}]}.

{#-
 Maximum number of offline messages that users can have:
#}
{access, max_user_offline_messages, [{5000, admin}, {100, all}]}.

{#-
 This rule allows access only for local users:
#}
{access, local, [{allow, local}]}.

{#-
 Only non-blocked users can use c2s connections:
#}
{access, c2s, [{deny, blocked},
	       {allow, all}]}.

{#-
 For all users except admins used "normal" shaper
#}
{access, c2s_shaper, [{none, admin},
		      {normal, all}]}.

{#-
 For all S2S connections used "fast" shaper
#}
{access, s2s_shaper, [{fast, all}]}.

{#-
 Only admins can send announcement messages:
#}
{access, announce, [{allow, admin}]}.

{#-
 Only admins can use configuration interface:
#}
{access, configure, [{allow, admin}]}.

{#-
 Admins of this server are also admins of MUC service:
#}
{access, muc_admin, [{allow, admin}]}.

{#-
 All users are allowed to use MUC service:
#}
{access, muc, [{allow, all}]}.

{#-
 No username can be registered via in-band registration:
 To enable in-band registration, replace 'deny' with 'allow'
 (note that if you remove mod_register from modules list then users will not
 be able to change their password as well as register).
 This setting is default because it's more safe.
#}
{access, register, [{deny, all}]}.

{#-
 By default frequency of account registrations from the same IP
 is limited to 1 account every 10 minutes. To disable put: infinity
{registration_timeout, 600}.
#}

{#-
 Everybody can create pubsub nodes
#}
{access, pubsub_createnode, [{allow, all}]}.

{#-
 Define specific Access rules in a virtual host.

 [
  {access, c2s, [{allow, admin}, {deny, all}]},
  {access, register, [{deny, all}]}

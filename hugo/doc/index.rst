Hugo
====

Introduction
------------

:doc:`index` is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for
speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and
templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data. And you can run
Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second. A
good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1
millisecond.

Hugo is meant to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles and
docs.

{#- flap_history is the lengh of history states we keep to look for
 flapping.
  20 by default, can be useful to increase it. Each flap_history
  increases cost:
    flap_history cost = 4Bytes * flap_history * (nb hosts + nb services)
 Example: 4 * 20 * (1000+10000) ~ 900Ko for a quite big conf. So, go for it! #}

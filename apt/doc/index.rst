APT

Introduction
------------

Formula that configures :ref:`glossary-APT` package manager.

The Advanced Package Tool, or APT, is a free software user interface that works
with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on the
`Debian`_ `GNU/Linux <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution/>`_
distribution and its variants. APT simplifies the process of managing software
on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and
installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by
compiling source code.

APT was originally designed as a front-end for dpkg to work with `Debian`_ 's
.deb packages, but it has since been modified to also work with the RPM Package
Manager system via APT-RPM. The Fink project has ported APT to Mac OS X for
some of its own package management tasks, and APT is also available in
OpenSolaris.

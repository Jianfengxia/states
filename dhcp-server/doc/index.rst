most efficient way to provide them. ISC :ref:`glossary-DHCP` is open source

to an IP network. It is production-grade software that offers a complete
solution for implementing :ref:`glossary-DHCP` servers, relay agents, and
clients for small local networks to large enterprises. ISC :ref:`glossary-DHCP`
solution supports both IPv4 and IPv6, and is suitable for use in high-volume and
high-reliability applications. :ref:`glossary-DHCP` is available for free
download under the terms of the `ISC License

SpamAssassin
============

Introduction
------------

SpamAssassin is a computer program released under the Apache License 2.0 used
for e-mail spam filtering based on content-matching rules. It is now part of the
Apache Foundation.

SpamAssassin uses a variety of spam-detection techniques, that includes DNS-based
and fuzzy-checksum-based spam detection, Bayesian filtering, external programs,
blacklists and online databases.

The program can be integrated with the mail server to automatically filter all
mail for a site. It can also be run by individual users on their own mailbox and
integrates with several mail programs. SpamAssassin is highly configurable; if
used as a system-wide filter it can still be configured to support per-user
preferences.

Mandatory
---------

Example::

  graphite:
    carbon:
      instances: 2
    retentions:
      default_1min_for_1_month:
        pattern: .*
        retentions: 60s:30d

graphite:carbon:instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of instances to deploy, should <= numbers of
`CPU cores <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor>`_.

graphite:retentions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of data retention rules, see the
`Graphite doc <http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf>`_
for details of syntax .

Optional
--------

Example::

  graphite:
    file-max: 65535
    carbon:
      replication: 1
      interface: 0.0.0.0
      max_creates_per_minute: inf
      max_updates_per_second: 500

graphite:file-max
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum of open files for the daemon.

Default: ``False``.

graphite:carbon:interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network interface to bind Carbon-relay daemon.

Default: ``0.0.0.0``.

graphite:carbon:max_creates_per_minute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Softly limits the number of whisper files that get created each minute.
Setting this value low (like at ``50``) is a good way to ensure your graphite
system will not be adversely impacted when a bunch of new metrics are
sent to it. The trade off is that it will take much longer for those metrics'
database files to all get created and thus longer until the data becomes usable.
Setting this value high (like ``inf`` for infinity) will cause graphite to create
the files quickly but at the risk of slowing I/O down considerably for a while.

Default: ``inf``. No limit.

graphite:carbon:max_updates_per_second
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limits the number of whisper update_many() calls per second, which effectively
means the number of write requests sent to the disk. This is intended to
prevent over-utilizing the disk and thus starving the rest of the system.
When the rate of required updates exceeds this, then carbon's caching will
take effect and increase the overall throughput accordingly.

Default: ``500``.

graphite:carbon:replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add redundancy of your data by replicating.

Every data point and relaying it to N caches (0 < N <= number of cache
instances).

Default: ``1``. Which is only one copy for each metric, thus no replication.

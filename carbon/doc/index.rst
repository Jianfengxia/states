Carbon
======

Introduction
------------

:doc:`/graphite/doc/index` is comprised of two components, a webapp frontend, and a backend (Carbon)
storage application. Data collection agents connect to carbon and send their data,
and carbon's job is to make that data available for real-time graphing immediately
and try to get it stored on disk as fast as possible.

DenyHosts
=========

Introducing
-----------

DenyHost is a script that analyzes the sshd log messages to determine what
hosts are attempting to hack into your system.

Upon discovering a repeated attack host, the /etc/hosts.deny file is updated to
prevent future break-in attempts from that host.

Installing
----------

After installing the Salt minion, from the Salt master you can run::
  
  salt myminion state.sls denyhosts -v

If you want to gather metrics and send to the Graphite::
  
  salt myminion state.sls denyhosts.diamond -v

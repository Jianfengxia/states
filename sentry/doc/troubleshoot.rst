Troubleshooting
===============

After create one user account. You can use admin account to mark that user as
admin by click ``Users`` at ``OVERVIEW`` section. Then click any user on list
users. Tick into ``Admin``.

Although you has been marked as admin. But when you login again. You can't have
full permission as complete admin. When click ``Create a New Team``. You will
get ``You do not have the required permissions to create new teams.``

So that mean on sentry has two kind of admin account.

Delete group Manually
---------------------

Sometimes it take so much time to delete a group that it timeout
:doc:`/nginx/doc/index` and :doc:`/uwsgi/doc/index`. A hack for this is to note
the group ID in the URL, such as:
https://sentry.example.com/team/project/group/1234/ the id is ``1234``.

Then run::

  /usr/local/sentry/manage  shell
  In [1]: from sentry.models import Group
  In [2]: Group.objects.get(id=1234).delete()

And wait, it can take a long time for group with 100 000 and more alerts.

XMPP Integration
----------------

``XMPP`` refer to the protocol of :doc:`/ejabberd/doc/index` and that allow
:doc:`index` to send chat notification to a conference room.

.. note::

  This plugin is configured **per project**, so different alerts can be sent to
  different conference room, these steps are required for each project.

#. Create :doc:`/ejabberd/doc/index` user for :doc:`index`, look in
   :ref:`ejabberd-usage-user_creation` for details.

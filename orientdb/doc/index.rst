OrientDB
========

.. from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OrientDB 2015-03-30

OrientDB is an open source :ref:`glossary-NoSQL` database management system
written in :doc:`/java/doc/index`. It is a document-based database, but the
relationships are managed as in graph databases with direct connections between
records. It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. It has a
strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports
:ref:`glossary-sql` as a query language. OrientDB uses a new indexing algorithm
called MVRB-Tree, derived from the redâ€“black tree and from the B+ tree; this
reportedly has benefits of having both fast insertions and fast lookups.

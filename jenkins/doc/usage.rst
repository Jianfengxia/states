Usage
=====

Follow the generic logic of pillar, apply formula and run checks, then perform
the followings.

Firstly, access one of the hostname that was specified at
:ref:`pillar-jenkins-hostnames` to access :doc:`/jenkins/doc/index` web UI.

Things you **should** do
------------------------

- Enable security in **Configure Global Security** to ``/configureSecurity/`` URL
  and have one account per user.
  After that, switch to **Matrix-based security** to prevent anonymous user to
  have read-only access to Jenkins.
- Install https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Timestamper and turn it
  on to all jobs.
- Set ``[a-zA-Z0-9\-]*`` as regular expression for job name. As job name are
  used to create VM hostname, this need to be a valid hostname.
- Do following steps in ``Manage Jenkins``.
- Set ``System Admin e-mail address``.
- Raise number of executor (``# of executors``) to large value such as ``20``.
- Set ``Jenkins URL`` to first value of ``jenkins:hostnames``.
- Configure SMTP to send email for build status change.

Manage Users
------------

Create
~~~~~~

Go to ``/securityRealm/addUser`` and fill the form and use a randomly generated secure
password. Click on **Sign up**.

Let know that person the username and password of the account with one of the hostname
in :ref:`pillar-jenkins-hostnames`.

.. warning::

  It's suggested to ask users to change their own password after first time they log in.

Then, grant the permission to that user at ``/configureSecurity/``, in **Authorization**
section, **Matrix-based security** sub-section, fill the newly created username in
**User/group to add**, click add. Select the various permission that user requires.

Delete
~~~~~~

Simply click on the red circle and a line on the user list ``/securityRealm/`` or go to
``/securityRealm/user/{{ USERNAME }}/delete``. With targeted username.

Edit
~~~~

Click on the tools icons on the user list ``/securityRealm/`` or go to
``/securityRealm/user/{{ USERNAME }}/configure``. With targeted username.

Useful plugins
--------------

.. note::

  all paths such as ``/log/all``, ``/configure`` are parts of URL after
  address of running :doc:`/jenkins/doc/index` server.

Jabber
~~~~~~

`jabber <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jabber+Plugin>`_
enables Jenkins to send build notifications via Jabber, as well as let users
talk to Jenkins via a 'bot' to run commands, query build status etc...
Jabber is also know as XMPP, an Jabber server can be installed using formula
:doc:`/ejabberd/doc/index`. After installing this plugin,
:doc:`/jenkins/doc/index` needs to restart. For troubleshooting, look at
``/log/all``.

Configure Jabber through ``/configure``, check ``Enable Jabber Notification``
fill in Jabber ID and password, server, port should suffice to make it work.
Additional configuration (such as setup jabber bot, choosing room to join,
...) can be made after choosing ``Advanced...`` button in this section.
Then, in each CI build configuration, choose ``Add post-build action``, then
``Jabber notification``, fill in the Jabber ID whom should receive notify
for the build job status.

Written at ``Jenkins ver. 1.545`` and plugin ``jabber 1.25``.

Multiple SCMs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multiple+SCMs+Plugin

Allow to checkout multiple repositories for a single project, such as more than
one :doc:`/git/server/doc/index`.

.. warning::

  This plugin don't work as expected on Jenkins slaves. You need to specify an
  ``Additional Behaviours``, choose ``Checkout to a sub directory`` and set
  ``Local subdirectory for repo``.

Build User Vars Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+User+Vars+Plugin

This plugin is used to set user build variables.

Builds that Disapears
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15156

The workaround is go ``/manage`` (Manage Jenkins) and click
**Reload Configuration from Disk**

Even if the bug 15156 had been marked as fixed, the problem still exists.

Introduction
------------

The Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd) is an open-source software product that
implements link-local advertisements of :ref:`glossary-IPv6` router addresses
and IPv6 routing prefixes using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) as
specified in RFC 2461. The Router Advertisement Daemon is used by system
administrators in stateless autoconfiguration methods of network hosts on
Internet Protocol version 6 networks.

Varnish
=======

Introduction
------------

An :ref:`glossary-HTTP` accelerator designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites
as well as heavily consumed APIs. In contrast to other web accelerators, such as
`Squid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)>`_, which began life as a
client-side cache, or `Apache
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_server>`_ and
:doc:`/nginx/doc/index`, which are primarily origin servers, Varnish was
designed as an :ref:`glossary-HTTP` accelerator. Varnish is focused exclusively
on :ref:`glossary-HTTP`, unlike other proxy servers that often support
:ref:`glossary-ftp`, :ref:`glossary-smtp` and other network protocols.

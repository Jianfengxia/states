An :ref:`glossary-HTTP` accelerator designed for content-heavy dynamic web
sites as well as heavily consumed APIs. In contrast to other web accelerators,
such as `Squid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)>`_, which began
life as a client-side cache, or
`Apache <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_server>`_
and :doc:`/nginx/doc/index`, which are primarily origin servers, Varnish was
designed as an :ref:`glossary-HTTP` accelerator. Varnish is focused exclusively
on :ref:`glossary-HTTP`, unlike other proxy servers that often support FTP, SMTP
and other network protocols.

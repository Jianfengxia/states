Pillar
=======

Optional
--------

Example::

  varnish:
  extra_config: |
    # Useless comment
  storage_backend: file
  file_size: 2G

varnish:default_backend_host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP address of default varnish backend.

Default: ``127.0.0.1``.

varnish:default_backend_port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Port of default varnish backend.

Default: ``8080``.

varnish:extra_config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra config to put in ``/etc/varnish/default.vcl``.

.. caution::

   Use with caution!  See `Varnish Configuration Language
   Document (VCL)
   <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/reference/vcl.html>`_.

   Invalid VCL will cause varnish daemon fail to start.

varnish:nfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum number of open files (for ulimit -n)

Default: ``131072``

varnish:memlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum locked memory size (for ulimit -l). Used for locking the
shared memory login memory.

Default: ``82000``

varnish:listen_address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP address to listen for client requests.

Possible values: A valid host name, IPv4 or IPv6 adress. If empty,
varnish will listen on all interfaces.

Default: empty

varnish:listen_port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCP port to listen for client requests.

Default: ``80``

varnish:telnet_address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP address to listen for management commands.

Possible values: A valid host name, IPv4 or IPv6 adress. If empty,
varnish will listen on all interfaces.

Default: ``127.0.0.1``

varnish:telnet_port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCP port to listen for management commands.

Default: ``6082``

varnish:storage_backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What storage backend varnish should use. See `varnish user's guide
<https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/storage-backends.html>`_
for more information.

This state does not support config for `persistent
<https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/storage-backends.html#persistent-experimental>`_
storage backend.

Possible values: ``file``, ``malloc``

Default: ``malloc``

varnish:malloc_size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum size varnish will allocate when using malloc storage backend.

Possible values: a number and one of following suffixes.

- K, k: kilobytes
- M, m: megabytes
- G, g: gigabytes
- T, t: terabytes

Default: ``2G``

varnish:file_path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path to varnish storage file when using file storage backend.

Default: ``/var/lib/varnish/<hostname>/varnish_storage.bin``

varnish:file_size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file size of varnish storage file when using file storage backend.

Possible values: a number and one of following suffixes.

- K, k: kilobytes
- M, m: megabytes
- G, g: gigabytes
- T, t: terabytes
- %: use up to this percent of available disk space

Default: ``2G``

.. note::

   If specify this value with suffix ``M`` or ``G``, this state will
   pre-allocate exactly this value of disk space before start
   varnish. This is a solution to prevent disk fragment.

   The pre-allocate action will not happen if the unit is ``K`` (too
   small) or ``T`` (too much time to pre-allocate).

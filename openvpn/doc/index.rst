OpenVPN
=======

OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements virtual private
network (:ref:`glossary-VPN`) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or
site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access
facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes
:doc:`/ssl/doc/index`/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network
address translators (NATs) and firewalls. It was written by James Yonan and is
published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

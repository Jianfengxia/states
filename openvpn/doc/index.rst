OpenVPN
=======

`OpenVPN <https://openvpn.net>`_ is an open-source software application that
implements virtual private network (:ref:`glossary-VPN`) techniques for creating
secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged
configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol
that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network
address translators (NATs) and firewalls. It was written by James Yonan and is
published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

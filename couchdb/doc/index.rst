CouchDB
=======

CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with
JSON documents. Access your documents and query your indexes with your web
browser, via HTTP. Index, combine, and transform your documents with
JavaScript. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can even
serve web apps directly out of CouchDB. And you can distribute your data, or
your apps, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s incremental replication. CouchDB
supports master-master setups with automatic conflict detection.

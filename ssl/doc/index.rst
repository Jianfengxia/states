SSL
===

Introduction
------------

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an
encrypted link between a server and a client—typically a web server (website) and
a browser; or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).

SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security
numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely. Normally, data sent
between browsers and web servers is sent in plain text—leaving you vulnerable to
eavesdropping. If an attacker is able to intercept all data being sent between a
browser and a web server they can see and use that information.

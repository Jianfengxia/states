Usage
=====

After :doc:`index` is installed and metrics are pouring into
:doc:`/carbon/doc/index` go into :doc:`/graphite/doc/index`.
In the list of metrics now appears a new root node with the
:doc:`/salt/minion/doc/index` grains ``id``.
Under it can be found the metrics sent by :doc:`index` under ``os``.

See :doc:`/graphite/doc/index` :doc:`/graphite/doc/usage` for more details.

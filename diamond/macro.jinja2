zcpupct: accept value=0 for cpu_percent metric (z stands for zero).
zmempct: accept value=0 for mem_percent metric.
If it is obvious that these value ares not equal zero, set them to False
to make sure receiving the expected metrics. E.g. jenkins daemon process sure
will use > 0 % memory percent, wrong diamond config may collect the value=0,
set zmempct=False to fail the test if that happens.

xinetd
======

xinetd is a powerful replacement for `inetd
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inetd>`_. It has access control mechanisms,
extensive logging capabilities, the ability to make services available based on
time, can place limits on the number of servers that can be started, and has
deployable defence mechanisms to protect against port scanners, among other
things.

PostgreSQL
==========

Introduction
------------

PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres", is an object-relational database management
system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.
As a database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and
supporting best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other software
applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer
across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from
small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many
concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database itself
for availability and scalability.

VirtualBox
==========

Introduction
------------

Oracle VM VirtualBox (formerly Sun VirtualBox, Sun xVM VirtualBox and innotek
VirtualBox) is a virtualization software package for x86 and AMD64/Intel64-based
computers from Oracle Corporation. innotek GmbH first developed the product;
Sun Microsystems purchased it in 2008; Oracle has continued development since 2010.

The VirtualBox package installs on an existing host operating system as an
application; this host application allows additional guest operating systems,
each known as a Guest OS, to load and run, each with its own virtual environment.

BIND
====

Introduction
------------

BIND_ is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
(:ref:`glossary-DNS`)
protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation of those
protocols, but it is also production-grade software, suitable for use in
high-volume and high-reliability applications.  The name BIND stands for
“Berkeley Internet Name Domain”, because the software originated in the early
1980s at the University of California at Berkeley.

BIND_ is by far the most widely used :ref:`glossary-DNS` software on the
Internet, providing a robust and stable platform on top of which organizations
can build distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those systems
are fully compliant with published :ref:`glossary-DNS` standards.

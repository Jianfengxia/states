SSMTP is a program which delivers email from a local computer to a configured
mailhost (mailhub). It is not a mail server (like feature-rich mail server
sendmail) and does not receive mail, expand aliases or manage a queue. One of
its primary uses is for forwarding automated email (like system alerts) off your
machine and to an external email address.

{#
 For some reason, purge nagios-nrpe-server Ubuntu package don't clean these.
 /var/run/nagios is $HOME of user nagios.
 So, when nagios-nrpe-server is uninstalled the first time the UID of this
 directory is changed to something else, once userdel nagios is executed.
 When nagios-nrpe-server is installed again, it can't write the PID file in
 /var/run/nagios. As the ownership is not for itself, it can't write the PID.
 This cause stopping the service to fail, as it can't find a PID.

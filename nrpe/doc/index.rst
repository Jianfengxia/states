NRPE
====

The NRPE addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on remote
Linux/Unix machines. The main reason for doing this is to allow Nagios to
monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage, etc.) on remote
machines. Since these public resources are not usually exposed to external
machines, an agent likeNRPE must be installed on the remote Linux/Unix
machines.

Please check
`the following <http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nrpe/NRPE.pdf>`_
page 1 and 2 for more details.

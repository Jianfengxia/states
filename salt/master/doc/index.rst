Salt Master

.. TODO: INTRODUCTION TO SALT MASTER

Consider seriously adding a :doc:`Salt Archive </salt/archive/server/doc/index>`
to the role of the Salt Master. That will speed up deployment of hosts and make
them more resilient on third-party failure.

In case there is no available git server already, adding
:doc:`Git server </git/server/doc/index>` to the role can be an option.
See :doc:`git` for details.

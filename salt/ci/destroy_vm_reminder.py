This script sends reminders to developers with open dev vms to close them when
they are done with them

This application requires the values below to exist in the salt master
configuration.

The destroy_vm_reminder/email/smtp dictionary is passed as-is to envelope's smtp
instance, see Envelopes documentation for details

The key_regexp must at least contain a group named user (i.e. something of the
form `(?P<user>PATTERN)`), which is used to retrieve the user's email address
from jenkins

Config example
==============

destroy_vm_reminder:
  key_regexp: some-prefix-(?P<user>.*)-some-suffix-[0-9]+
  key_glob: integration-dev-*-*
  jenkins_prefix: http://jenkins.example.com
  destroy_job: destroy-dev-vm
  email:
    from: admin@example.com
    subject: 'Please remember to destroy your vms'
    smtp:
      host: smpt.example.com
      port: 25
      login: myuser
      password: mypassword
      tls: (boolean)
      timeout: (float)
    message_template: |
                      {{ name }}:

                      You have the following VMs open:{% for vm in vms %}
                      - {{ vm }}{% endfor %}

                      Please go to
                      {{ url }}
                      and destroy them if you're done with them

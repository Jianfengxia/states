Introduction
------------

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go_ is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms
make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked
machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program
construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast,
statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
interpreted language.

helper functions and classes used throughout the :doc:`Common
</doc/intro>` python code which provide shortcuts and facilities for
common functionality and configurations such as logging, yaml config
file unserialization, process configuration and most prominently a
base class to create python command line applications that use common

to crating nrpe checks for your formulas.

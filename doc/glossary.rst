C++
~~~

`C++ <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_ (pronounced cee plus plus) is a
general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and
generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level
memory manipulation.

.. _glossary-ttl:

TTL
~~~

`Time to live <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live>`_ (TTL) or hop limit
is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or
network. TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or
embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed,
data is discarded. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from
circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is used to improve
performance of caching or to improve privacy.

DSL
~~~

A `domain-specific language
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language>`_ (DSL) is a computer
language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to
a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains,
and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

API
~~~

An `application programming interface
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_ (API) is a
set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API
expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and
underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of their
respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary
without compromising each other.

.. _glossary-version-control:

Version Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is the
management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and
other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or
letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply
"revision".

.. _glossary-javascript:

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

`JavaScript <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_ (JS) is a dynamic
computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers,
whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user,
control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content
that is displayed. It is also used in server-side network programming with
runtime environments such as :doc:`/nodejs/doc/index`, game development and the
creation of desktop and mobile applications.

network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host
over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP is built on a client-server
architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client
and the server.

Updates
=======

- Testing framework had been updated to automatically create 99% of the tests to perform and it's now possible to write more complex test suite with salt states directly instead of writing python code.
- Automatic discovery mecanism used to configure monitoring. Requires less code and less human intervention.
- Better error handling in state 'dnsimple.present'
- All services now specify an "order" argument to make sure they run before automated testing.
- A lot of minor improvements.
- Most states ID are the same in their absent counterpart to make sure there is conflict of ID if the $state and $state.absent get both included in highstate

Fixes
=====

Pillars
=======

- two pillar key that used to be a URL/path to a file that contains private data had been replaced by pillar key that hold the contains of the file, so everything is in pillars:
  - apt_source replaced apt:sources (see apt/init.sls for details)
  - deployment_key_source replaced by deployment_key (see ssh/client/init.sls for details)
  - ssl had not beeb replace, but rather it's structure change, the content of SSL keys are now pillars. (see ssl/init.sls for details).
- Many new states added in this release have their own pillars key, please check those states for a list.
- Elasticsearch pillars data structure had been changed to allow more precision regarding service port, this was required to allow ES and GL2 server to run on the same host at the same time.
- The following pillars key aren't used anymore as they used to configure Amazon SES which is now deprecated:
  - graphite:web:email
  - amazon-ses
  - sentry:email
- Some keys had been added to replace old one:
  - graphite:web:smtp instead of graphite:web:email
  - sentry:web:smtp instead of sentry:web:email
- Many pillars values are now optional, default value are used when not specified:
  - debug
  - memcache:memory
  - graphite:web:db:name
  - graphite:web:db:username
  - graylog2:email:tls
  - graylog2:email:user
  - graylog2:email:password

NodeJS
======

`Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ is a platform built on Chrome's
JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network
applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

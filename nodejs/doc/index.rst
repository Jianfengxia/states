NodeJS
======

`Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ is a platform built on
`Chrome<http://www.google.com/chrome/>_`\'s :ref:`glossary-javascript` runtime
for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an
event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient,
perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed
devices.
